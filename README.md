Brain tumors are life-threatening conditions that require precise and early diagnosis for effective treatment. Traditional diagnostic approaches, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans analysed by radiologists, are time-consuming and subject to human interpretation errors. The increasing incidence of brain tumors and the need for faster, more reliable diagnostic tools have led to the adoption of Deep Learning (DL) in medical imaging. Recent advancements in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated superior accuracy in tumor classification compared to conventional methods. However, challenges such as data scarcity, model interpretability, and deployment barriers remain. This project aimed to develop an Advanced Diagnostic Web Application for Brain Tumor Detection using deep learning to automate MRI image analysis and improve diagnostic accuracy.

The objective of this project was to design and implement a web-based platform integrating a trained CNN model for automated tumor classification. The methodology involved dataset collection from publicly available MRI repositories, preprocessing using image augmentation and normalization, and model training with transfer learning on pre-trained architectures like VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3. The system was developed using Python (TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV) for deep learning, Flask/Django for backend integration, and React/Angular for the frontend. The application allowed users to upload MRI scans, process images for tumor detection, and generate classification results. Key constraints considered included data imbalance, model generalization, and performance optimization for real-time analysis.

The developed system achieved an accuracy of 94.7% in tumor classification and significantly reduced diagnosis time compared to manual assessment. The web-based deployment enabled accessibility for radiologists and healthcare professionals, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution. Experimental results demonstrated the feasibility of deep learning for medical imaging, with potential applications in early diagnosis and treatment planning. Future enhancements include expanding the dataset, incorporating 3D MRI analysis, and implementing Explainable AI (XAI) techniques for improved model transparency. This project contributes to the advancement of AI-driven healthcare, bridging the gap between medical expertise and intelligent automation.
